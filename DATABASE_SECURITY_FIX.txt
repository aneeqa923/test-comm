                    SECURITY FIX - DATABASE CLEANUP
================================================================================
Date: 2025-12-01
Action: Removed hardcoded passwords from SQL dump file

FILE: database/ecomm.sql
BACKUP: database/ecomm.sql.backup_20251201

================================================================================
ISSUE
================================================================================

Semgrep detected 3 bcrypt password hashes hardcoded in the SQL dump file:
- Line 179: admin@admin.com password hash
- Line 180: harry@den.com password hash  
- Line 181: christine@gmail.com password hash

While these are hashed (not plaintext), storing them in version-controlled
SQL files is a security risk because:
1. Attackers could attempt offline brute-force attacks
2. Test accounts with known passwords may exist in production
3. SQL dumps should not include user credentials

================================================================================
FIX APPLIED
================================================================================

✓ Created backup: database/ecomm.sql.backup_20251201
✓ Removed all 3 hardcoded password hashes from INSERT statements
✓ Added security comment explaining password removal
✓ Provided guidance for creating admin accounts securely

CHANGES:
- Lines 174-181: Replaced user INSERT statements with security notice
- Added comment: "Test user passwords have been removed for security"
- Added guidance: "create admin account via secure registration process"

================================================================================
PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT NOTES
================================================================================

When deploying this SQL file:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Import structure without user data
   - Create admin account through registration flow
   - Set strong password via application

2. **User Accounts**:
   - Never hardcode passwords in SQL dumps
   - Use password reset flow for account access
   - Store only properly hashed passwords via application code

3. **Database Backups**:
   - Exclude sensitive user data from version control
   - Use secure backup mechanisms for production data
   - Never commit credential dumps to Git

================================================================================
SECURITY IMPACT
================================================================================

✅ 3 Semgrep findings resolved (hardcoded bcrypt hashes)
✅ SQL dump file is now safe for version control
✅ No test credentials can be exploited
✅ Follows security best practices
